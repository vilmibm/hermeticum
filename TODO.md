blowing off the dust

- [ ] single binary
- [X] add in cobra
- [ ] peercred `s := grpc.NewServer(grpc.Creds(&ServerAuthCredentials{}))` `type ServerAuthCredentials struct { credentials.TransportCredentials}`
- [ ] gut client and remake as basic as possible (maybe still with tview for two pane)
- [ ] trim down protobuff (draw up new api)
